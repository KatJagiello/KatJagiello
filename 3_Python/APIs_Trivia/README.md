## üí° Key Concepts & Code Highlights

This project demonstrates several important programming concepts:

#### 1. Reusable API Function
A generic function `get_api_data(url)` was created to handle all API calls. This function includes robust `try...except` error handling, preventing the application from crashing due to network issues and making the code more modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

#### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The API response contained HTML-encoded characters. The `html.unescape()` function was used to clean the question and answer text before displaying it to the user, ensuring a clean and readable experience.

```python
# Cleans up the formatting - I was getting weird characters without it
question_text = html.unescape(q['question']) 
correct_answer = html.unescape(q['correct_answer'])
incorrect_answers = [html.unescape(ans) for ans in q['incorrect_answers']]
